Since the beginning of the year, I've been using a new TypeScript library called [Effect](https://www.effect.website/) on personal and work projects at [doubleloop.io](https://doubleloop.io/).

Effect solves common problems we face every day in software development like concurrency, composability, and making things explicit.

I wrote this article based on the [talk](https://github.com/devmatteini/socrates-2023/blob/9f9c4348caeddecbf23fcb1325ddd036f97770af/effect-talk/build-applications-with-effect.pdf) I presented at [SoCraTes Italy 2023](https://www.socrates-conference.it/).

## What is Effect?

Effect allows to build complex and composable applications with a strong focus on type safety and error handling.

Yes, this is quite a generic and broad definition.
I like that this library provides you all the building blocks to create your application without compromising on anything important.

The image below summarize some of the core features part of the ecosystem:

/>

On this article I'm going to focus on `Concurrency`, `Dependency Injection` and a little bit of `Observability`.

## Let's build an application

We're going to rebuild the main workflow of my personal project [football-calendar](https://github.com/devmatteini/football-calendar/).

I created this application to sync google calendar with football matches of my favorite team to solve a problem I was facing using different football mobile apps.

I retrieve football matches from [api-football.com](https://www.api-football.com/) and I use Google Calendar as database and front end to display football matches as events.

The workflow of the app is:

-   Retrieve football matches from `api-football.com` and calendar events from `Google Calendar`
-   Elaborate those data and produce a list of commands (for example, to create a new calendar event or update an existing one)
-   Execute the commands to update the database

<Image
    src="/blog/build-applications-with-effect/football-calendar-architecture.webp"
    alt="Map of Effect features"
    width={864}
    height={250}
/>

Let's start from an empty function, `footballMatchEventsHandler`, that given a `teamId` will execute the workflow of the app:

```ts title="src/football-match-events-handler.ts" showLineNumbers
export const footballMatchEventsHandler = (teamId: number) => {
    throw new Error("TBI")
}
```

What should be the return type of this function? The `Effect<R, E, A>` type!

### The `Effect` type

`Effect<R, E, A>` type is lazy and immutable description of a workflow.

-   `R` or `Requirements` type parameter: the dependencies that the Effect needs to be executed
-   `E` or `Error` type parameter: the expected errors that this Effect may produce
-   `A` or `Value` type parameter: the value of the succeeded Effect

We can say that `footballMatchEventsHandler` function returns a `Effect<never, never, void>` which means that this effect has no requirements (`R = never`), doesn't produce any expected error (`E = never`) and also doesn't return any value (`A = void`).

```ts showLineNumbers
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"

export const footballMatchEventsHandler = (teamId: number): Effect.Effect<never, never, void> => {
    throw new Error("TBI")
}
```

## Retrieve football matches

Let's start by retrieving the football matches. We need to pass a `loadMatchesByTeam` function to `footballMatchEventsHandler` and for this we can use the `Requirements` of the `Effect` type.

We need to create a type or interface where we can define all requirements.

```ts showLineNumbers
export type Deps = {
    loadMatchesByTeam: (teamId: number) => Effect.Effect<never, never, readonly FootballMatch[]>
}
```

Then we need to create a representation of `Deps` at value-level using a `Tag`:

```ts showLineNumbers
import * as Context from "effect/Context"

export type Deps = {...}
export const Deps = Context.Tag<Deps>()
```

Now that we have defined the `Deps` type, let's change the return type of `footballMatchEventsHandler`

```ts showLineNumbers /Deps/
export const footballMatchEventsHandler = (teamId: number): Effect.Effect<Deps, never, void> => {
    throw new Error("TBI")
}
```

To use the requirements we have to start our pipeline (in alternative you can use [generators](https://www.effect.website/docs/essentials/using-generators)) to extract and invoke `loadMatchesByTeam`:

```ts showLineNumbers
import * as F from "effect/Function"

export const footballMatchEventsHandler = (teamId: number): Effect.Effect<Deps, never, void> =>
    F.pipe(
        Deps, // ðŸ‘ˆ Tags can be used as an Effect
        Effect.flatMap(({ loadMatchesByTeam }) => loadMatchesByTeam(teamId)),
        //     ðŸ‘† flatMap allows to access the `A` of the previous `Effect` and return an new `Effect<R | R1, E | E1, B>`
    )
```

If we run the application, we can see that `loadMatchesByTeam` is executed!

```
{"message":"start loadMatchesByTeam","timestamp":"2023-11-05T15:11:45.178Z","level":"DEBUG","fiberId":"#0","teamId":"502"}
{"message":"loadMatchesByTeam done","timestamp":"2023-11-05T15:11:46.186Z","level":"DEBUG","fiberId":"#0","teamId":"502"}
```

<Alert variant="info">
    I'm using a [custom
    logger](https://www.effect.website/docs/observability/logging#custom-loggers) to have structured
    logs in json
</Alert>

## Retrieve calendar events

This should be easier, we know what we have to do.

First we add `loadCalendarEventsByTeam` function to `Deps`.

```ts showLineNumbers
export type Deps = {
    loadMatchesByTeam: (teamId: number) => Effect.Effect<never, never, readonly FootballMatch[]>
    loadCalendarEventsByTeam: (
        teamId: number,
    ) => Effect.Effect<never, never, readonly CalendarEvent[]>
}
```

Then to always have the requirements in scope we have to create a _second pipeline_.

```ts {5} showLineNumbers /loadCalendarEventsByTeam/
export const footballMatchEventsHandler = (teamId: number): Effect.Effect<Deps, never, void> =>
    F.pipe(
        Deps,
        Effect.flatMap(({ loadMatchesByTeam, loadCalendarEventsByTeam }) =>
            F.pipe(loadMatchesByTeam(teamId)),
        ),
    )
```

We are already invoking `loadMatchesByTeam` but we also want to invoke `loadCalendarEventsByTeam`.

How can we combine many effects into one? Using `Effect.all`.

```ts {6-9} showLineNumbers
export const footballMatchEventsHandler = (teamId: number): Effect.Effect<Deps, never, void> =>
    F.pipe(
        Deps,
        Effect.flatMap(({ loadMatchesByTeam, loadCalendarEventsByTeam }) =>
            F.pipe(
                Effect.all({
                    matches: loadMatchesByTeam(teamId),
                    calendarEvents: loadCalendarEventsByTeam(teamId),
                }),
            ),
        ),
    )
```

In TypeScript you would have used `Promise.all`, but with `Effect.all` you gain proper type safe error handling and more interesting behaviors we'll see in the next section.

Now if we run the application, both football matches and calendar events are retrieved.

```
{"message":"start loadMatchesByTeam","timestamp":"2023-11-05T15:40:50.688Z","level":"DEBUG","fiberId":"#0","teamId":"502"}
{"message":"loadMatchesByTeam done","timestamp":"2023-11-05T15:40:51.715Z","level":"DEBUG","fiberId":"#0","teamId":"502"}
{"message":"start loadCalendarEventsByTeam","timestamp":"2023-11-05T15:40:51.715Z","level":"DEBUG","fiberId":"#0","teamId":"502"}
{"message":"loadCalendarEventsByTeam done","timestamp":"2023-11-05T15:40:52.647Z","level":"DEBUG","fiberId":"#0","teamId":"502"}
```

## Controlled concurrency

If you have a closer look at the order of the logs (and the timestamps) we can see that they are executed sequentially.
This is the default behavior of every effects.

Even though this two effects are quite fast, we can easily experiment and try to run them concurrently.

`Effect.all` accepts a second parameter where we can specify the concurrency, in this case we only have two effects so we can set it to 2.

From now onwards, the code snippets are going to focus on the second pipeline.

```ts {7} showLineNumbers
F.pipe(
    Effect.all(
        {
            matches: loadMatchesByTeam(teamId),
            calendarEvents: loadCalendarEventsByTeam(teamId),
        },
        { concurrency: 2 },
    ),
)
```

And now the output changes as both effects starts concurrently:

```text /loadMatchesByTeam/#purple /loadCalendarEventsByTeam/#green
{"message":"start loadMatchesByTeam","timestamp":"2023-11-05T15:44:38.195Z","level":"DEBUG","fiberId":"#3","teamId":"502"}
{"message":"start loadCalendarEventsByTeam","timestamp":"2023-11-05T15:44:38.251Z","level":"DEBUG","fiberId":"#4","teamId":"502"}
{"message":"loadCalendarEventsByTeam done","timestamp":"2023-11-05T15:44:39.538Z","level":"DEBUG","fiberId":"#4","teamId":"502"}
{"message":"loadMatchesByTeam done","timestamp":"2023-11-05T15:44:39.669Z","level":"DEBUG","fiberId":"#3","teamId":"502"}
```

## Create commands and observability

Now that we have both football matches and calendar events we can produce the list of commands to execute.

```ts {9} showLineNumbers
F.pipe(
    Effect.all(
        {
            matches: loadMatchesByTeam(teamId),
            calendarEvents: loadCalendarEventsByTeam(teamId),
        },
        { concurrency: 2 },
    ),
    Effect.map(elaborateData),
    //    ðŸ‘† map allows to access the `A` of the previous `Effect` and return `B` as Effect Value
)

// The union type of commands
type FootballMatchEvent =
    | CreateFootballMatchEvent
    | UpdateFootballMatchEvent
    | NothingChangedFootballMatchEvent

// We're not going into domain specific details
declare const elaborateData: (_: {
    matches: readonly FootballMatch[]
    calendarEvents: readonly CalendarEvent[]
}) => readonly FootballMatchEvent[]
```

Great! But what if I would like to know how many `Create` or `Update` commands needs to be executed?

We can use the built-in logger and `Effect.tap` function.

```ts {4-13} showLineNumbers
F.pipe(
    // ...
    Effect.map(elaborateData),
    Effect.tap((commands) =>
        // ðŸ‘† tap allows to "execute" an Effect without changing the `A` type
        F.pipe(
            // Use built-in logger to log a string
            Effect.logInfo("Commands to execute"),
            // And then we can enrich our log with
            // additional data, for example a summary of our commands
            Effect.annotateLogs(toSummary(commands)),
        ),
    ),
)

type Summary = { create: number; update: number; nothingChanged: number }
declare const toSummary: (commands: readonly FootballMatchEvent[]) => Summary
```

And as we run the application, we can see the log and the annotations we added.

```json {6-7,9}
{
    "message": "Commands to execute",
    "timestamp": "2023-11-05T17:08:34.477Z",
    "level": "INFO",
    "fiberId": "#0",
    "create": "31",
    "update": "0",
    "teamId": "502",
    "nothingChanged": "0"
}
```

<Alert variant="info">
    You may have noticed that `teamId` was always present in all logs. Once you annotate an Effect, every log inside that Effect will be
    annotated.

    ```ts
    // application entry point
    F.pipe(
        // keep new line
        footballMatchEventsHandler(teamId),
        Effect.annotateLogs({ teamId }),
    )
    ```

</Alert>

## Execute commands

We're almost done. This is the last part and our application will be completed!
We have to execute the commands to update the database (Google Calendar).

We don't need to do anything for commands of type `NothingChanged`, so let's filter them out of the list.

```ts {6} showLineNumbers
F.pipe(
    // ...
    Effect.tap((commands) =>
        F.pipe(Effect.logInfo("Commands to execute"), Effect.annotateLogs(toSummary(commands))),
    ),
    Effect.map(filterCreateOrUpdateEvents),
)

type CreateOrUpdateEvent = Exclude<FootballMatchEvent, { _tag: "NOTHING_CHANGED" }>
declare const filterCreateOrUpdateEvents: (
    events: readonly FootballMatchEvent[],
) => CreateOrUpdateEvent[]
```

To create or update calendar events we need two new requirements: `createCalendarEvent` and `updateCalendarEvent`.

```ts showLineNumbers
export type Deps = {
    // ...
    createCalendarEvent: (command: CreateFootballMatchEvent) => Effect.Effect<never, never, void>
    updateCalendarEvent: (command: UpdateFootballMatchEvent) => Effect.Effect<never, never, void>
}
```

What is left to do now is to invoke `createCalendarEvent` or `updateCalendarEvent` based on the command type.
Here comes handy the `Match` module that allows to do exhaustive pattern matching (like [ts-pattern](https://github.com/gvergnaud/ts-pattern), but deeply integrated into the Effect ecosystem and conventions).

```ts showLineNumbers
import * as Match from "effect/Match"

const createOrUpdate = (create: Deps["createCalendarEvent"], update: Deps["updateCalendarEvent"]) =>
    F.pipe(
        Match.type<CreateOrUpdateEvent>(),
        Match.tag("CREATE", (x) => create(x)),
        //    ðŸ‘† Effect convention is to use `_tag` as tag/discriminant property.
        //       For example `type CreateFootballMatchEvent = { _tag: "CREATE", ... }`
        Match.tag("UPDATE", (x) => update(x)),
        Match.exhaustive,
    )
```

And inside `footballMatchEventsHandler` we can use it like this:

```ts showLineNumbers {11-12,17-26}
import * as ROA from "effect/ReadonlyArray"
//          ðŸ‘† Shorthand for ReadonlyArray (coming from fp-ts, old habits die hard ðŸ˜„)

export const footballMatchEventsHandler = (teamId: number): Effect.Effect<Deps, never, void> =>
    F.pipe(
        Deps,
        Effect.flatMap(
            ({
                loadMatchesByTeam,
                loadCalendarEventsByTeam,
                createCalendarEvent,
                updateCalendarEvent,
            }) =>
                F.pipe(
                    // ...
                    Effect.map(filterCreateOrUpdateEvents),
                    Effect.flatMap((commands) => {
                        // Effect.Effect<never, never, void>[]
                        const effects = ROA.map(
                            commands,
                            createOrUpdate(createCalendarEvent, updateCalendarEvent),
                        )
                        // You can also pass an array of Effects instead of an object to `Effect.all`
                        return Effect.all(effects, { discard: true })
                        //                          ðŸ‘† This sets the `A` to void, since we don't care about the array of results
                    }),
                ),
        ),
    )
```

Finally we can see that we are creating new calendar events!

```
{"message":"Calendar event created","timestamp":"2023-11-05T22:21:14.599Z","level":"DEBUG","fiberId":"#0","matchDate":"2023-11-12T14:00:00.000Z","competition":"Serie A","teamId":"502","match":"Fiorentina-Bologna","matchId":"1052363"}
{"message":"Calendar event created","timestamp":"2023-11-05T22:21:15.524Z","level":"DEBUG","fiberId":"#0","matchDate":"2023-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","competition":"Serie A","teamId":"502","match":"AC Milan-Fiorentina","matchId":"1052380"}
{"message":"Calendar event created","timestamp":"2023-11-05T22:21:16.747Z","level":"DEBUG","fiberId":"#0","matchDate":"2023-12-03T14:00:00.000Z","competition":"Serie A","teamId":"502","match":"Fiorentina-Salernitana","matchId":"1052383"}
{"message":"Calendar event created","timestamp":"2023-11-05T22:21:17.671Z","level":"DEBUG","fiberId":"#0","matchDate":"2023-12-10T19:45:00.000Z","competition":"Serie A","teamId":"502","match":"AS Roma-Fiorentina","matchId":"1052401"}
// ...
```

The whole process to create 31 calendar events took 40 seconds. Let's see if we can improve it using concurrency like before.

## Uncontrolled concurrency

Until now we always specified a fixed number of concurrent effects, but we can also use `unbounded` to run as many effects as possible concurrently. Let's try it!

```ts {6} showLineNumbers /unbounded/
F.pipe(
    // ...
    Effect.map(filterCreateOrUpdateEvents),
    Effect.flatMap((commands) => {
        const effects = ROA.map(commands, createOrUpdate(createCalendarEvent, updateCalendarEvent))
        return Effect.all(effects, { discard: true, concurrency: "unbounded" })
    }),
)
```

Let's run the application and see how much time it takes.

```json /Error: Rate Limit Exceeded/#red
{"message":"Commands to execute","timestamp":"2023-11-05T22:38:52.022Z","level":"INFO","fiberId":"#0","create":"31","update":"0","teamId":"502","nothingChanged":"0"}
{
    "message": "Unexpected application error",
    "timestamp": "2023-11-05T22:38:52.664Z",
    "level": "ERROR",
    "cause": "Error: Unable to insert google calendar event: Error: Rate Limit Exceeded (...omitting stack trace...)",
    "teamId": 502
}
```

Oh no, we broke the application! As you can see from the error message the Google Calendar API responded with a "Rate Limit Exceeded" because we were doing too many requests concurrently.
We can say that using concurrency `unbounded` can be a double-edged sword and we have to be careful when to use it.

We can fix this issue in two way:

1. Using controlled concurrency
2. Using the [Scheduling](https://www.effect.website/docs/scheduling/introduction) module, [retrying](https://www.effect.website/docs/error-management/retrying) to insert/update a calendar event following a policy we define (for example with exponential backoff when we exceed the rate limit)

Since this application is simple I chose option 1, as having 5 concurrent effects is absolutely fine for this scenario.

We made it! We re-implemented the whole workflow of my app ðŸŽ‰!

## Run an Effect and provide Requirements

I'm sure you still have questions/doubts about what we did, for example how do I provide the implementation of the requirements? How do you actually execute an Effect? And many more...

I'll try to answer some of those questions by writing a test.

To run an Effect we can use:

-   `Effect.runPromise` returns a Promise that may reject if the Effect produce an error
-   `Effect.runPromiseExit` return always a fulfilled Promise with the `Exit` type, which is a union of `Failure<E, A> | Success<E, A>`

We can write a test to check that a calendar event is created when there's a new football match:

```ts title="src/football-match-events-handler.test.ts" showLineNumbers /Effect.runPromiseExit/#error
import { expect, test } from "vitest"
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"
import { footballMatchEventsHandler } from "./football-match-events-handler"

test("create football match event", async () => {
    const result = await F.pipe(
        // keep new line
        footballMatchEventsHandler(anyTeam),
        Effect.runPromiseExit,
    )

    expect(Exit.isSuccess(result)).toBeTruthy()
})

const anyTeam = 1
```

There's something wrong, we got a type error at `Effect.runPromiseExit`!

```text {4}
Argument of type '<E, A>(effect: Effect<never, E, A>) => Promise<Exit<E, A>>' is not assignable to parameter of type '(a: Effect<Deps, never, void>) => Promise<Exit<never, void>>'.
  Types of parameters 'effect' and 'a' are incompatible.
    Type 'Effect<Deps, never, void>' is not assignable to type 'Effect<never, never, void>'.
      Type 'Deps' is not assignable to type 'never'.ts(2345)
```

Do you remember earlier we sad that the Effect returned by `footballMatchEventsHandler` needs requirements (`Deps`) to be executed? This error warns us about that!

We need to provide an implementation of `Deps` _and then_ we can call `Effect.runPromiseExit`.

```ts showLineNumbers
import { expect, test, vi } from "vitest"
import { Deps, footballMatchEventsHandler } from "./football-match-events-handler"

test("create football match event", async () => {
    const createCalendarEvent = vi.fn(() => Effect.unit)
    //                             ðŸ‘† create a spy function

    // We create a stub implementation of `Deps`.
    // The convention is to call it <Tag>Test and the real implementation <Tag>Live
    const DepsTest = Deps.of({
        loadMatchesByTeam: () => Effect.succeed([anyFootballMatch]),
        loadCalendarEventsByTeam: () => Effect.succeed([]),
        createCalendarEvent,
        updateCalendarEvent: () => Effect.unit,
    })

    const result = await F.pipe(
        footballMatchEventsHandler(anyTeam),
        Effect.provideService(Deps, DepsTest),
        //     ðŸ‘† we provide the implementation of the tag Deps
        Effect.runPromiseExit,
    )

    expect(Exit.isSuccess(result)).toBeTruthy()
    expect(createCalendarEvent).toHaveBeenCalledOnce()
})

declare const anyFootballMatch: FootballMatch
```

I modified the code we wrote in this article to make it simpler to understand and remove domain implementation details.

You can find maintained and up-to-date code in the `main` branch inside [devmatteini/football-calendar](https://github.com/devmatteini/football-calendar) repository. If you want to explore more, this is the right place to start!

## Conclusion

We started exploring Effect and there is a lot more to see and try.

What we just did is a very common workflow: retrieve data from external sources, do some business logic and save the results to a database.

What I like about Effect is that you can experiment, iterate and refactor with confidence that your application won't break.
Effect leverage the type system to make things explicit: errors and requirements. No more looking at code to understand what errors it may produce.

The learning curve may seem high at first, but from my experience I can say that it was worth it because I enjoy writing TypeScript with Effect much more.
